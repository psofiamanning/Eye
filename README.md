## Description
In this exercise, 2 eyes are created on the screen. The eyes are able to follow the movement of the cursor along the screen. 

## What's included?
This repository includes 3 files:
1. index.html - where the javascript code and css styles code of Mapbox are called. It also calls the mapanimation.js file
2. mapanimation.js - has the formulas that allow the marker in the map to move throughout the bus stops
3. styles.css - has the styles of the html file
